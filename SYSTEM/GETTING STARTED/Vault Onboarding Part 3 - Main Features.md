tab: Page Task
#### How to toggle?
- Hotkey - **`Ctrl+Space`**
- Floating Action Button - **`Toggle Page Task`**
#### What happens when toggled?
After pressing you will notice that a **checkbox icon will appear beside the name of the file.**  If you press it again this will **mark it as done.** From there, if you press it again it will **remove the icon meaning the page is not marked** (no longer a page task).

#### What can you toggle as a **`Page Task`**?
**All notes** can be toggled with this.

#### Special toggle command for **`Project`** and **`Meeting`** notes.
- @ For **Project Files** if you select a **"Status"** then toggle Page Task, the note will be **marked as "4. Completed" and the icon will change.** From there, if you toggle it again it will **revert it to the previous status** if you've set it to something set or if not then it will default back to **"1. To Do"**.
- @ For **Meeting Files** if the **"Meeting Status"** is **"Done"** or **"Not Done"** when Page Task is toggled the **icon and Meeting Status changes respectively**.

#### **Important Notes:**
- ? The action that will occur when you tooggle **Page Task** will depend on the **current state of the file**.
	- if it is not marked with anything
	- if it is marked as not completed task
	- if it is marked as completed task
- ? If it is marked as either **completed** or **not completed** task, it will **always appear in your inbox**.

#### If you're worried about creating **Map of Contents for specific topic groups**, the **Area Family handles that well**. 
![[Vault Onboarding Part 3 - Main Features-11.png]]
