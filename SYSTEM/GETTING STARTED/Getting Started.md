# Reference files:
1. [[Concept Inspiration and Reference]]
# Notes:
- / This vault creates a strong division between **PARA** and the **ZETA** (Zettelkasten) method of note taking. 
- / You can easily monitor **projects** with the **Project component**
- / The **Area component** allows you to **create MOC's** for topics you wish to explore
	- ? I like to use The **ZETA** component for inputs/concepts not related to **PARA** (since in my case PARA focuses on the development of a skill or things that are work related)
- / Some of the dataview tables in the **Homepage** are **listed/sorted based on the modified date** and the displayed notes are limited to **15** notes
	- & This will help you with scaling your vault so you can navigate to the most recent files
- @ CSS snippets were kept mostly untouched so you can **personalize the vault on how you want it to look like**
#### **I highly advise you to go over the documentations so you get to utilize the full potential of the vault**
