	- ? **YOU DO THIS SO THAT THINGS ARE PROPERLY CONFIGURED AND YOU CAN UTILIZE ALL THE FEATURES.**
``````tabs
tab: Vault Easy Setup (Recommended)
1. **Open an existing vault**
2. Press **`Ctrl + P`** then search **Open another Vault**
3. **Select Create a new vault**
![[Vault Onboarding Part create new vault.png]]
in my example I have it named: **`Test`**
4. In the vault you just created go to **`Settings >  Community PLugin`** then select **`Turn on Community Plugin`**
![[Vault Onboarding Part turn on.png]]
5. Press **`Ctrl + P`** then search **Reload app without saving**
6. **Close the Vault you just created (IMPORTANT)**
7. **Extract the `.zip`** file, **copy all the contents** then go to the **folder of the vault you just created**, **delete** the existing contents and **paste** the copied contents there

8. **Open the vault you just created**

tab: Top Right
#### Right Click the **Todo List button** then select **close**
![[Vault Onboarding-4.png]]
#### **If the Graph is not working** open a random note, right click the tab, hover to **"Open Linked View"**  then select **"Open Local Graph"**

You can now drag that local graph tab into the top right buttons.
**Note: This updates with the current tab you have opened**.


tab: Middle Right
#### If the **"Outline of Homepage"** is not working properly
You first close it.
![[Vault Onboarding-6.png]]
Then press **"Ctrl + P"** then type **"Outline: Show outline"** and **select** it. It should appear in the top right buttons, you just drag it where you want it.

tab: Status Bar Bottons
#### Go to **Settings > Commander > Status Bar** 
**You will now add these two` commands:**
![[Vault Onboarding Part 1.png|450x237]]

These are what you will search for when you select **"Add Command"**. 
- Omnisearch: Vault Search
![[Vault Onboarding-10.png|350x50]]
- Fullscreen focus mode
![[Vault Onboarding Part 1-1.png|350x50]]

**Note: You can select the icon for the button and the name when you hover the mouse button**.

#### Go to **Settings > Status Bar Organizer** 
Then arrange the status bar icons on how you want it.
I personally like to keep mine like this:

**Note: These yellow boxes are the commands you added with the commander plugin**.
