# Getting Started
**The vault is mainly divided into two parts:** 
- / **PARA:** Project, Area, Resources, Archive
- / **ZETA:** Fleeting Note, Permanent Note, Literature Note
 If you want your vault to scale well in the long run **you must understand your use case for the vault and follow a separation rule for your note inputs.**
- ? **My use case example:** 
	- @ my **PARA** file inputs are things that are related to the development of a skill or things that might be doing that is work related.
	- @ my **ZETA** file inputs are concepts for the brain that is **not PARA related.**
